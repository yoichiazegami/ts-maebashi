um so at this time our next speaker is
Mary is it Faber or
Farber okay I'm just asking because it's
spelled so simply uh product and brand
designer originally from uh New Zealand
is actually located here in Brisbane and
she's going to be speaking about AI
generated fonts and hopefully future
advancements let's see what she has to
say thank
you okay amazing it's the time has come
uh unfortunately I couldn't get AI to
present this for me uh that would have
been really fantastic but you'll just
have to deal with me in the
meantime uh a little bit about me just
quickly I love the world of
typography uh some photos with some
famous people in type Jessica he some
Delon mug people Mar and Benes and I
love the history of fonts too and so on
the letter press machine doing some hand
leathering some carving into stone uh
pretty much love it
all uh I now work as a brand and product
designer at a place called Joseph Mark
they're here in Brisbane um and yes I'm
from New Zealand I actually did recently
move back to New Zealand but was living
in Brisbane for two years uh now we
don't often design custom font at of
Mark but we do do custom logo types now
and then and obviously typography is a
huge part of what we do so um I'm the
one that's selling the fonts to the
clients so you're
welcome okay so could AI be the future
of font design this is a really big
question um probably should have put a
few extra question marks after that uh
but uh that's kind of what I set out to
look at um but I have to preface with a
couple of things first of all AI
expert I am not um I have uh worked with
quite a few AI tools we integrate AI
tools into our workflows as much as we
can where I work at present um so as
much as I know my way around some of the
tools I don't write the
models uh secondly font design expert
again I mean I do try um and I did work
uh about 10 years ago I worked for a
year at a Foundry in London called
Dalton M um and the main project I
worked on while I was there was one
called Intel clear celic no I don't
speak Russian uh but so I guess I have
some knowledge about the process of
Designing fonts for like commercial use
and what goes into that so I do have a
level of understanding coming
in can't cover font engineering uh
simply no time and if I could uh it
wouldn't be me doing that talk it would
be somebody else giving that talk so
unfortunately can't cover that today and
last but not least uh copyright and
plagiarism again not enough time so
fortunately a talk after M which you
might have seen on the program is
covering this so I was very I was very
lucky to see that uh because that's yeah
another kettle of fish and epic says if
you wish to improve be content to appear
clueless or stupid and luckily for you
I'm prepared to do that today so um
let's get into it taking a look at the
current state of affairs when it comes
to AI so most of you will know uh at the
moment crafting new professional type
faces remains a meticulous and timec
consuming Endeavor even with modern
software and uh I guess the premise is
that if AI could increase the speed at
which well-crafted fonts are produced or
perhaps that which variations of forms
are explored it could significantly
change the font design design landscape
now current advances in the area
Revolution are happening on more
pixel-based formats so the top is a a
video production by AI from about a year
ago and that's uh The Prompt was Will
Smith eating spaghetti and I think we
can all agree it's quite horrendous and
shocking but the bottom video
productions are from more recent ones
from uh a generator called SOA soaa and
these are far more convincing admittedly
cherry-picked from some of the you know
from some of the good ones uh but
nevertheless the level of realism is is
Extreme and so these advances are
happening at a pretty rapid rate uh the
issue is vector graphics which are
integral to font design uh they're
moving at a much slower Pace with only a
handful of papers surfacing last year um
and for the next slide or two I'm
referencing an online article but um by
Philip Pala and Jamie Clark um and
that's from the end of this year so I'd
actually started doing my talk and then
stumbled across this article and I was
like oh I need to change a few things
and that is the nature of AI because
I've had discussions with a lot of
people in this room over the last day or
two and already I want to change slides
in here um especially after hearing Yung
Yin speak yesterday Simon's talk um was
about to add a few few of his slides in
but I thought I better stick to what I
had so significant progress is occurring
in what is known as few sh shot font
generation tasks so basically AI
learning a font style from a small set
of initial characters and then
extrapolating that knowledge to create
an entire font and that's kind of what
was touched upon in the talk yesterday
with the cjk characters um but I can
confirm it is happening for Latin there
was a question posed um and it was is
this happening for Latin type faces as
well and this particular paper did look
at applying it to Latin forms now I'll
admit I'm not picking any of those fonts
of the Shelf um and uh probably better
on maybe a defont website but
nevertheless these were basically
created by inputting a few glyphs and
then extrapolating from that the
knowledge and then creating kind of
fully-fledged glyph sets so um and these
are like copyable vector fonts um and
this is a program called or or a model
called jeel vector and I kind of dive a
little bit deeper into this um because
this was pretty much the top of what I
could find out there for Vector
vectorizing fonts at the moment in terms
of what's happening with
AI so this is a kind of a closer look at
what's happening and uh basically the
top line is the kind of input font this
is what we're trying to achieve
basically a slab syif nothing too fancy
going on and so the A and the B that are
kind of outlined in the top left red
those were the input glyphs and then
they will run through these different
models here and so the second one down
is this dual vector and uh so basically
you've got two glyphs input it and then
extrapolate an entire glyph set from
that and so it's not perfect and there's
some kind of weird things happening like
the tail on the JS um and some kind of
where the curves are happening there's
some kind of weird stuff happening at
the top of the G there but in terms of
uh developments from some previous
models which are shown below so you've
got these other like I don't know how to
say it at2 R2 F and I am to ve um some
of these previous Explorations are far
more rudimentary and distorted so I
think what dual Vector has done is about
the closest we've got um and so I think
if you look at it from a lens of okay
I'm still not going to use that and
where are the where are the nodes place
and can I use it for mult mle Masters
probably not but if you think of that
being the new standard and then that
being the on the Bottom Rung what are
the iterations that are going to happen
getting closer and closer to the output
that you're after so um I think the
developments that are happening uh could
progress um and be something that is
usable uh again same same model so same
framework but looking at an italic um
which has probably got a bit more uh
idiosyncrasy going on particularly with
like the double story G that's probably
one of the hardest characters here for
them to kind of replicate but if you
look at some of the terminals and some
of the thicks and thins that are
happening again the Dual Vector is doing
a reasonable job of it and yeah again
still not quite there in terms of what
you would want on a commercial scale but
I think the improvements kind of speak
for themselves when you see them all
together up
here now I'm I am not the one to explain
this but I thought for any of the
technical people in the room that it
would be important for me to include
this slide and attempt to explain it at
least on a very rudimentary level
basically it works similarly to what I
understood Simon saying yesterday and
basically it's compiling vectors
together pieces of vectors together one
over the other kind of like components
coming together and then it's also got
this kind of image Branch so like a
predictable model of what the like a
rasid image would look like of a letter
form and then when you combine those
things and compile those two things
together it can kind of use the image of
the reference as the final output that
we want to achieve and then kind of
adjust the vectors to to fit that more
closely rather than being solely Vector
based um and so I think Pro probably and
I don't know because I haven't seen the
outlines of these fonts uh there's
probably uh a few more nodes than what
we wanting and probably you might spend
more time at this point editing what any
output was rather than actually saving
time probably quicker to draw it from
scratch but I think this level of
progression that's happening um it's
certainly something to look out for and
consider moving
forward okay so that's about as far as
it gets in terms of font design
specifically and vectors but I thought
because that was kind of as far as I
could get with it I also wanted to look
at what's happening in the world of
typography so lettering as well because
that's something that you know AI
conference is about lettering too and I
thought hey this is something that we
can explore as well so image-based
applications and typography are evolving
at a rapid rate so decorative lettering
outputs are now a prompt away um and
also uh really AI is only going to be as
good as how it's integrated into tools
that everyday designers can use if
they're not readily available they're
not going to be in use so I started to
have a look at what's currently out
there so in March 23 Adobe Firefly AA
art generator was released and this is
um just quickly an illustrator the text
to Vector graphic tool then uh canva in
December of last year released magic
studio um and this is a tool called
Magic morph basically input a letter
form and then add a prompt I want it to
look like a balloon and then it creates
this so in the past this might have been
an art directed photo shoot and maybe
you needed to have a balloon that was in
a PE shape maybe you had to get it
custom made uh who knows but now it's
kind of a prompt
away uh these are some outputs from mid
Journey uh 2022 36 Days of type um uh
sorry the the 36 Days of type is from
last year but mid Journey was released
in 22 uh and I imagine having used my
journey a bit myself that these would
have taken quite a few iterations
because uh when you are using AI it's
almost like the outcomes can almost be
um not quite what you're expecting but
then you have to add quite a lot of
levels of refinement but in terms of
these being final outputs for a lead
earing project I think it's pretty
impressive um and not having to use 3D
software in order to do this um is a
huge
timesaver so I had to have a go um now
again not an expert and uh I needed a
cover page for my talk and I thought
what would be a big challenge for AI is
probably creating a really clean sense
serif rather than a decorative letter
form so I thought okay I don't have the
vector output tools at my disposal but I
do have some of the image creation tools
at my disposal so let's try and create a
cover page for this talk Adobe
Illustrator I asked s Ser uppercase
letter m
ooh okay um can't say I was going to use
one of those for the cover of my talk uh
I was like all right all right all right
I got the prompt wrong let's trag in uh
letter M black clean in the style of
helvetica don't shoot me I heard the
last talk but I was like if if they're
going to know a Sans serif grotesque
what's what's a well-known one that the
computer might
recognize oh okay um things got worse so
uh this is a closeup of the one that was
probably the best of the bunch um and if
you look at where the vector points are
placed um I would spend more time
cleaning this up than if I'd drawn it
from scratch so that was out the window
I turned to Mid Journey um and the
prompt is Le m helvetica style uh white
background okay um we're still not
getting it um I don't know where the
serifs came from but they're there I
added to the prompt with no serifs or
detail still not hitting the mark does
doesn't listen does not listen um these
were some more trials the bottom right
is about the closest we got but still
not quite what I was after so let's try
something else uh I wanted to create my
name and have some lowercase letter
forms I was like that would be cool
let's see what we can do I used the
blend tool so combining a few different
letter forms and then getting an output
this was not bad so this was four
outputs and then the bottom right I
don't know where the outlines came from
but the bottom right was the best one
and I zoomed into that and I thought oh
I upscaled it and I was like yeah like
if this is image based but if I could
convert the vectors uh convert the image
to vectors I was like this is pretty
good then I tried a lowercase a and
bearing in mind I input lowercase days
um it was all downhill from there so the
M got my hopes up it really really did
uh I don't know what's happening here uh
I could go on and on about what's wrong
with it but certainly nothing's right
about it uh same with the r it got worse
um so nothing good to see here and then
why um I really special um uh an n and
some y inside a V and a T and A Y so um
yeah it just kind of progressively went
downhill so I became map and uh the best
I could be was about this Mary with a
little te so I could be Mt if if you
prefer okay I turned to Dary that's
another image generation tool and uh
same kind of
prompts um I think I preferred mid
journey serifs to what this was giving
me uh then I tried some more prompts
again it got worse so darly was not the
one at the end of the day and then I
thought is it just me do I not know what
I'm doing but these are some other
prompts in mid Journey from someone else
and what they're trying to create sure
like there's some interesting nice
things happening here but their prompts
did not match up with their outputs not
even close and I saw how many iterations
they were trying and it was like me stab
in the dark stab in the dark stab in the
dark this was a hilarious one that
someone had tried and basically amazing
output of the Muppets band but if we
zoom into what's happening with the type
on the drum what is going on it's like
you can get everything else right but
type is not
trained okay so where do we go from here
um looked at some online conversations
um very varied in uh opinions on what
might be achievable sometimes quite
polar takes whether or not these shifts
are going to be positive or not um but
the impending shifts seem to be
undeniable these are some predictions of
the medium-term impact of AI on type
design kind of two main scenarios that
were kind of appearing so the first is
fully AI generated fonts fonts on the
fly so kind of input a prompt something
comes out I see this being something
that could happen and I don't think the
fonts are going to be particularly great
but they might be the kind of thing that
rudimentary people coming in with not a
lot of font design knowledge would use
all the time it would be like daffon on
steroids um because you wouldn't even
have to search for fonts anymore you'd
just type in a prompt I see it happening
not ideal for font designers but they
will lack
craftsmanship so the second one is AI is
co-pilot so basically AI takes on the
heavy lifting in the traditionally
arduous tasks and that's kind of what
Simon spoke about yesterday it's like
give us some basic beautiful characters
to go off and we'll extrapolate that for
you and I think that done well and
leveraging AI in that manner could be a
great outcome for type designers because
it could mean some really beautiful
fonts uh created at a at a faster
rate this was a guy who said the the
third one could be fonts are no longer
needed so I don't know if that's utopian
or dystopian for me it would be
dystopian uh but imagine a world where
lettering isn't static but dynamically
adapts to context a level of flexibility
and precision that goes beyond what
current fonts offer and admittedly I
think that would take a hugely long time
but it's interesting to see the opinions
on where this could
go so a successful outcome I think for
all would take industry professionals
behind the tool developments to power
the best font design outcomes and to
implement mechanisms to safeguard
against plagiarism that way as The
Gatekeepers and drivers they would then
stand to gain the most from future AI
developments okay last harah I still
needed a cover for this talk back to Mid
Journey it was went to the vector and
it's it's worse again I couldn't believe
it um so and I don't know where this
little guy down the bottom came from um
but I couldn't use any of that uh so I
decided to go down the creative
lettering route rather than try and
create a sand serif because clearly
that's not the game that we're playing
uh so I had real I had quite a lot of
fun and this was just one evening at
home playing around I'm not a 3D artist
but these are some outputs that I
managed to get I do love what's
happening in the bottom left here this
kind of glassy effect on the M but I
decided to go with this one on the end
because it felt like kind of warped kind
of not quite right kind of interesting
and unusual and adaptive and I kind of
feel like that's where we're at with AI
at the
moment so uh could AI be the future of
font design I think arguably yes I I
think it's it's coming um but based on
what I've found so far AI is not my type
yet thank you
[Applause]
thank you very much and because we
started about five minutes late we have
some time for questions oh great
sorry thank you so much um so uh a few
months ago um there there was a tweet on
Twitter I'm never gonna say I'm never
going to call it X um in Japan that went
viral that um how to distinguish like AI
picture or the real picture is uh to
look at type because AI is now as you
shown really terrible at uh creating
types and um well it will get better
soon and then um as a as a type people
in in the field we probably may have to
think about that uh um pressure on us
too because now that's also how to
distinguish how people distinguish the
correct information or not so I guess
that's another thing we need to think
about yeah what what um I totally agree
um and I guess that is starting to go
into the kind of uh plagiarism
discussion because it's going to be is
this something that someone's created is
has this been ripped off from someone um
and it is I think it is a slippery slope
because it can be really difficult to
disting between what's been created by
Ai and what hasn't and certainly uh I've
been using a lot for kind of more
photography based applications in my
work and it really it is quite shocking
like you almost can't tell and
originally with with photography at
least the hands were a giveaway it's
like the hands looked really warped but
even in in the last year that's improved
a bunch so I think the sad answer is it
will be very difficult to distinguish
between the two in
future another question
question so my theory with the AI is
because it draws from so many
copyrighted sources all bunched in
together that eventually the AI is going
to have to be monitored by if not a
human then another Ai and so what we end
up with is this Loop of the AI
monitoring the AI monitoring deeper and
deeper and
deeper is this something you've thought
about yourself and and do you have any
thoughts on
that I mean personally I'm no expert
like I said I think uh that's something
that can definitely happen I think uh a
side note to that kind of a s side step
is something I've thought about is uh
what happens when uh there's no more new
inputs being being done because
everyone's like well AI is just going to
knock keep knocking things out and I had
this discussion with a few people in the
audience already uh if you don't have
the source material to create anything
new then it's all just going to be the
same and recycled and homogeneous and
there won't be anything new so I think I
think that's probably where the value
for font foundaries will still lie is
creating beautiful Source material and
in fact maybe it will be worth more
because there will be far less Source
material to go from um if we are using
those as reference
I also think maybe the tools um should
they be open source for font design or
should they be something that happens
inhouse so that you've got the tools to
use with your own font designs but you
are not allowed to use them with other
people's I don't know fude for thought
thank you very
much I have one last question
did I sorry did I just hear you say that
the value of foundaries in the future is
to create Source material for
AI no well I think the the the value
will be that their Source material could
then be sold for people who are wanting
to use AI who's buying the data for AI
aren't they just hoovering it up well
this is the thing this is why I'm
thinking maybe the models that people
are using are not open source maybe they
are like Vector based ones because at
the moment I I don't have access other
than Adobe text to illustrator thing
that I tried earlier uh the the like the
jewel vector and stuff it's not a
readily available tool to public so I'm
thinking maybe these are tools that
could be used by foundaries in and of
their own with their own products so
like the extrapolating from a few letter
forms out you can only do that with your
own fonts but putting roadblocks up from
other people put putting it out there
that's another kettle of fish that's
that's a whole can of
worms thank you very much we will be
moving into our NE thank you
[Applause]
thanks
e for
